## About HeartClicker

Heart Clicker is a web application that generates random love phrases every time we "click" on the image.

Possible improvements:
1- Add a counter for the times you have tapped on the heart.
2- Add an icon of a love letter that shows all the phrases that have already appeared on the screen.
3- Add a gallery of hearts so you can change the default color of the heart.
